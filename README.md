## **Motivation**
------
When you are online shopping, do you find yourselves going to the sales section immediately and you don't ever buy regular price items? I find myself doing that and I believed many other people do that too. Therefore, I thought it would be convenient if there is a website that only display on sale items

## **Getting Started**
-----
To use this application, simply go to the deployed site or click [HERE](https://sales-catalog.herokuapp.com/). You can toggle on and off for different brands. The on sale items from the selected brands will be displayed on the same page.

### **Customization**
This repository is only the front-end of Sales Catalog. The on sale items information are drawn from the [API](http://enigmatic-tundra-66827.herokuapp.com/api/uniqlo).To display information that the current version does not have, you may make request to different API (or build your own) and obtain the neccesary information. Sales Catalog is a decoupled application so it allows the flexiblity to use different front-end and back-end. The changes will need to be made to the useEffect function located in Page component.
